* Facial recognition implementation using Keras VGG face
* Important note: 
* The weights and model are not in github due to large size.
* Please run the machine learning program (jupyter notebook) first to generate weight and model.
* Run face_detection.py for still images
* Run facecam_detection.py for video images
